## Ducky-Scripts

Just some rubber ducky scripts I created for fun.


### Wifi-Key-Post-Request
This dumps Windows wifi passwords to a HTTP server via POST requests. This first version sends each wifi password as a separate POST request.

### Wifi-Key-Post-Request-V2
This also dumps Windows wifi passwords to a HTTP server via POST request. V2 sends them all in one nicely formatted POST request.

[This script](https://gist.github.com/mdonkers/63e115cc0c79b4f6b8b3a6b797e485c7) is an easy python-based HTTP server that supports POST requests.
